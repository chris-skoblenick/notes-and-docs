# What is this?
Notes from "Grow Your Own Tech Leads" video, by Ken Scambler

# Leveling up
* Gap between Senior and Lead isn't about coding ability; it's interpersonal skills
  * People skills ARE learnable
  * Generally people learn the same way, but sucking at it for a while.
* As you go up the managerial ladder, you loose depth, gain breadth.

# Trust (around 5:30) 
* You grow by earning trust (of the company, of your team members)
  * For senrior, generally you just grow trust by being good at their job.
  * As you expand, it's about growing trust outside of your function (PM, design, etc)
* Trust is necessary to have the other side really hear what is being said

## Follow up on what you say (7:00)
* Your manager is constantly checking back in to see if things are done
* The manager's calendar gets clogged up if they can't trust; constantly being worried about when the last time they were checked in on. 
* How often your boss needs to check up on you, is a sign things aren't going well.

## When you get stuck, communicate (11:30)
* Instead of thinking "I don't know what I don't know"; when you don't know something, you're certain you don't know something.
* It's going very poorly when you spend a whole bunch of time trying to be un-stuck, then leave everything to the last minute
  * Suddenly your boss has to helicopter in extra resources to deliver at the eleventh hour.
  * Leads to your boss constantly needing to check up on you (see previous point).
* Your bosses' boss is going to be getting roasted because you're not making progress clearly.
* Instead, as soon as it's not going well, flag it as early as possible
  * Allows your boss to have maximum options to provide help
* "No one is expected to know the answers"
  * Builds trust with your boss by being able to not be worried about, and belive progress is what it's said.

## When you commit to something, deliver it (15:50)
* When you say you're going to do something, things are expected to be comitted.
* If you don't know how to do it, just say something! Don't become an obstacle.
  * This can really build trust; they know when you commit, you can deliver it.
* You can build power & trust not always by doing it themself, but also by being able to point them to somewhere or someone who can do it.
  * Even in this case, you become someone to funnel requests to

# Insecurity (21:00)
* A primary barier for many people doing this is insecurity; fearing dissapointment of others, especially in leadership.
  * As a leader, manager, they feel like they must know these things
  * Junior developers are generally really good about this, but dries up quickly

## "I'm not good enough..." to ask questions/give opinions
  * Everyone misses out on what they have to say; get drowned out by the noisy questions
  * Mentor people to speak up
  * People running the meetings can make space for quiet people to speak up
  * Managers should try to setup pervasive personal safety

## Loud and overpowering
* Sometimes, people over-compensate by being loud and obnoxious
* Leaders can fall into this trap

## Defencively Opaque
* "I don't understand well enough, so I have to make it hard to understand what I'm saying, so no one will ask questions"

### Last stage: given up
* Generally need to be removed

# Inexperienced Leaders (29:00)

## Being too rigid
* "Do this, or else" to everyone
* Happens when they feel like they must be be the authority on all things
* Super demotivated team
* People won't really listen and follow anyways

## Being too flexible 
* Feels like there's no leader
* Leads to chaos and lack of leadership
* Completely abdicating technical leadership entirely & accountability
* It's as toxic as the other behaviours!
* Lack of accountability can spread

## Acountability
* Core thing that leaders must create
* When people have ideas, allow them to follow it, but hold them accountable

# Being Open (33:30)
* "Your code is bad, and you are bad" likely isn't going to have the right effect
  * Won't improve their code, others will likely not want to participate
  * While it's already bad as a peer, it's very destructive when leaders do it.
    * Can destroy team culture
    * Can cause others to hide their actions
* The more senior, the more consequences your words have.
* In conversations with a large audience, words must be chosen carefully
  * In private, it's much easier to truly speak openly.

# Creating Opportunities
* Creating formalized opportinities is quite a bit harder (requires sign-off)
* Instead, look for informal opportunities as ways to grow leadership.
  * Within tasks, projects, objectives, within teams, etc.
