# Personality

## Personality Typing Results:
- Myers & Briggs: INTJ
- DISC: C, with a strong lean towards D

## What I value & respect in others:
- continuous improvement: striving towards excellence, not accepting average.
- critical thinking: strong opinions, freely shared, weakly held.
- ability to admit something isn't clear or known, and strive to clarify it.
- someone who focuses discussion on actions, outcomes and changes, not complaining.
- intelligence: either deep or broad.
- drive: someone who seeks to get out of life what they want, instead of hoping it happens to them.
- accepts and celebrates failure; I value the attempt.

## Irritated by:
- closed minded or idle discussion & small talk: I want each interaction to have a purpose.
- being prevented from making progress on that which is most important.
- being okay with average
- accepting errors, inefficiency, disorganization or broken processes because that's how it always was.
- not delivering on promises: do not commit if you cannot produce, just say no when asked.
- having an overly managed appearance; politics, focus on social norms over honesty.
- over focus on age or experience over merit; great ideas can come from anywhere, at any time.


# Operating Environment:

## Work Cadence:
- mentally engaged with work 24/7, but doesn't expect others to be.
- Prefers to start around 9:30am, and generally resists starting before this time unless necessary.
- Prefers to end around 6:00pm, but always willing to work later if needed.
- Prefers access to deep focus periods, one in the morning (before noon) and at towards the end of the day.
- Dislikes meetings without a very clear agenda: I need to know what success looks like in every meeting, and to know when we're done.

## Communication Style:
- tends to be very focused on specific issues/topics, rather than general discussion.
- focuses on shared understanding: frequently uses visual aides, metaphores and restating others viewpoints to verify agreement.
- must understand why, not just what, is being proposed.
- tends to require clear restatement of take aways, actions and next steps before concluding.

## Prefered Methods of Communication:
- face-to-face (in-person or virtual with web cams) for important or complex topics: reads visual/audio cues to look for geniune understanding.
- instant messaging (Slack/text) for uni-directional (FYI) or simple question and answer.
- e-mail as a last resort; infrequently read and thought of as low-priority informational or nice to know.
