# Personality

## Personality Typing Results:
- Myers & Briggs: INTJ
- DISC: C, with a strong lean towards D

## What I value & respect in others:
- continuous improvement: striving towards excellence, not accepting average.
- critical thinking: strong opinions, freely shared, weakly held.
- ability to admit something isn't clear or known, and strive to clarify it.
- focus on actions, solutions and improvements instead of blame, innaction and excuses.

## Irritated by:
- closed minded or idle discussion & small talk: I want each interaction to have a purpose.
- being prevented from making progress on that which is most important (to me)
- being okay with average
- accepting errors, disorganization and broken processes because that's how it always was.
- not delivering on promises: do not commit if you cannot produce, just say no when asked.
- having an overly managed appearance; politics, focus on social norms over honesty.


# Operating Environment:

## Work Cadence:
- Prefers access to deep focus periods, one in the morning (11am -> 12pm) and at the end of the day (5 -> 6pm).
- Dislikes unscheduled calls/meetings: prefers to mentally prepare with a clear context and purpose.
- mentally engaged with work 24/7, but doesn't expect others to be.

## Communication Style:
- Puts a lot of effort to ensure shared understanding: frequently uses visual aides and metaphores.
- Wants to know why, not just what to do.
- Craves clarity about the goal of the discussion, and a clear understanding of when we are done.
- Focuses on clear take aways, actions and next steps.

## Prefered Methods of Communication:
- In-person for important or complex topics: reads visual/audio cues to look for geniune understanding.
- Instant Messaging (Slack/Text) for uni-directional (FYI) or simple question and answer.
- E-mail as a last resort; infrequently read and thought of as low-priority informational or nice to know.


# Features

- Working towards long-term, meaningful objectives.
